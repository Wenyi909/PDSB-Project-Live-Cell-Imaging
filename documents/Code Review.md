## Code Review
### I. For Anikap22's Project on Neighborhood effects of N-fixing trees
##### 1. In reviewing your peer's projects did you find that their README files made it clear what their project is, how to install it, and how to use it? Do you think that your README file does a good job at this?
Yes. Anikap's README file has clear descriptions of the project, and the installation procedure. The file does not specify how to use the package, but refers to the notebook file for usage instruction.
##### 2. Did your peer have Python scripts in a directory named project, and were you able to understand the structure of the python scripts?
Yes, there is a python script, but the structure is not very clear. There is only the script for class objects, but no `setup.py` or `__init__.py`. 
##### 3. Did your peer provide example notebooks in the notebooks directory? Does the README file link to, or tell you about the example notebooks? Were you able to understand from the example notebooks how to use the code, or what your peer is trying to solve in the notebook?
Yes, there is an example notebook in the notebook directory, and the readme file does mention the notebook for usage instruction. The example notebook is clear and easy to follow, as there are a lot of explanations of each section of codes. 
##### 4. Did you come up with any ideas for improving your own project by reviewing your peer's project directories?
I learn that it is helpful to annotate important steps within the code, so that it would be easier for users to trace the logic and for developers to tackle problems.

### II. For Chloehacker's Project on Public Transportation Ridership and Climate Data
##### 1. In reviewing your peer's projects did you find that their README files made it clear what their project is, how to install it, and how to use it? Do you think that your README file does a good job at this?
Yes. Chloehacker's README file has clear descriptions of the project, and the installation procedure. The readme file does not specify the usage, but has very detailed reference to each notebook for analysis and tutorial.
##### 2. Did your peer have Python scripts in a directory named project, and were you able to understand the structure of the python scripts?
No, I didn't find a python script. I guess all the code is stored and presented in different notebook files. 
##### 3. Did your peer provide example notebooks in the notebooks directory? Does the README file link to, or tell you about the example notebooks? Were you able to understand from the example notebooks how to use the code, or what your peer is trying to solve in the notebook?
Yes, there are four example notebooks in the notebook directory, and the readme file does link to the notebooks for demonstration. Most notebooks, especially the `Mapping Ridership tutorial`, are well-annotated and easy to follow. Only the `Graphing ridership tutorial` has only code, thus a bit hard to understand. 
##### 4. Did you come up with any ideas for improving your own project by reviewing your peer's project directories?
I find it helpful to separate different sections of project into different notebook files. Maybe structurally this would be more clear for users to direct themselves into the parts they are interested.

### III. For kuratanp's project on MlClusters
##### 1. In reviewing your peer's projects did you find that their README files made it clear what their project is, how to install it, and how to use it? Do you think that your README file does a good job at this?
Yes. kuratanp's README file has clear project descriptions, and installation procedure. The readme file directs the usage the notebook directory.
##### 2. Did your peer have Python scripts in a directory named project, and were you able to understand the structure of the python scripts?
Yes, I find the code in `mlclusters` directory. The code has very clear structure, but the class object only has private functions. I guess maybe the `_evaluate_performance` function could be public.  
##### 3. Did your peer provide example notebooks in the notebooks directory? Does the README file link to, or tell you about the example notebooks? Were you able to understand from the example notebooks how to use the code, or what your peer is trying to solve in the notebook?
Yes, there are six notebooks in the notebook directory, with two as example notebooks. Both `mlclusters_nb_v1.ipynb` and `mlclusters_nb_simulated_data.ipynb` are very well-structured and clear with labeled steps.  
##### 4. Did you come up with any ideas for improving your own project by reviewing your peer's project directories?
Having an index for all the steps and the entire pipeline is very helpful for clarification. Also explaining blocks of code within the class object in the notebook is probably a good way of demonstrating how the library works.
